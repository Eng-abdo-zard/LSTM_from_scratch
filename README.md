This project contains a simplified numerical example to illustrate how an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) cell works using Python. It performs a forward pass through the LSTM cell and computes the outputs while providing detailed debugging information at each time step.

## Code Overview

- **initialize_params**: Initializes the LSTM parameters (weights and biases) with the input, hidden, and output dimensions.
- **lstm_cell_forward**: Executes one forward step through the LSTM cell, calculating the forget, input, candidate, and output gates.
- **lstm_forward_sequence**: Processes an entire sequence through the LSTM using the cell for each time step.
- **predict_lstm**: Obtains the final prediction from the LSTM based on the last hidden state.
- **update_with_manual_params**: Updates the LSTM parameters with manual values for testing purposes.
- **debug_lstm_steps**: Prints detailed debug information for each time step during the LSTM forward pass, including raw computations and activated outputs.
- **main**: Defines a simple sequence, initializes parameters, performs the debug steps, and prints the final prediction along with a comparison to an expected value.

## Requirements

- **Python 3**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
- **Required Libraries**:
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for mathematical operations and array handling.
